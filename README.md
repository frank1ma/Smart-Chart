# Smart-Chart, a plot viewer for control system software/application based on PySide6

Despite the extensive capabilities of the matplotlib library, which includes the provision of numerous control application-related plots such as Bode plots, Nyquist plots, Nichols plots, and root locus, there remains a distinct lack of interactive capabilities with the graphical interface. While matplotlib does incorporate its own navigator, the addition of further functionalities often presents challenges.

In response to this, the Smart Chart library has been developed, utilizing PySide6 as a foundation, with the express purpose of enhancing graphical interaction capabilities. This development now facilitates the straightforward creation of Bode plots and Nichols charts. Moreover, it allows for the measurement of distances within these plots, the addition of auxiliary lines, and the execution of fundamental view operations.
